 A project to learn about the [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) graphics API.
 
## About Sethlans

Sethlans is named after [Sethlans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sethlans_(mythology)) the god of fire and forge in the Etruscan mythology.
The project aims to create a graphics engine based on the [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) graphics API, using [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org) librairies and [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) 1.16.
It is first and foremost a learning hobby project, but might be involved with concrete project implementations in the future.
